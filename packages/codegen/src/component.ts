 * and stylesheet as sibling JSON-string fields -- generateObject/structured
 * output is solid for short, schema-friendly data (this codebase's only
 * existing precedent, src/lib/code-review/*.ts, generates short JSON
 * findings), but two independently-generated large source files inside one
 * schema have nothing forcing them to actually agree with each other (a
 * class name typo'd differently in each field is a likely, hard-to-catch
 * failure mode), and large source files as JSON-string values are more
 * failure-prone (escaping, truncation) than plain text generation.
 *
 * Pipeline instead:
 * 1. contract (generateObject, genuinely schema-friendly: prop names/
 *    types, chosen CSS class names, chosen token references).
 * 2/3/4. TSX / stylesheet / stories, each a plain generateText completion
 *    given the SAME contract as fixed shared input, so all three are
 *    forced to agree on names instead of guessing independently.
 * Then a deterministic (no LLM) check that every class the TSX references
 * actually exists in the generated stylesheet, run BEFORE anything is
 * committed (see src/lib/github/client.ts's caller in the codegen route).
 *
 * A real `tsc --noEmit`-in-package-context gate (as originally scoped) is
 * NOT done here: that needs the design-system repo's own toolchain
 * (React/TypeScript/Vite) available, which isn't practical to install
 * inside a Vercel serverless invocation under a 60s budget. Instead the
 * design-system repo runs its own CI (typecheck/lint/build) on the pull
 * request this generates, and a person reviews that status before clicking
