/**
 * Every class name CSS Modules would expose as an export key from this
 * stylesheet -- i.e. every `.identifier` token appearing ANYWHERE in a
 * selector, not just ones written as their own standalone top-level rule.
 * Real CSS Modules tooling (css-loader, Vite, PostCSS) extracts a class
 * from any selector position: compound (`.toggle.checked`), combinator
 * (`.list .item`), comma-separated (`.a, .b`), pseudo-class (`.btn:hover`),
 * inside @media, etc.
 *
 * A previous version of this function only matched a class if it was the
 * FIRST token of a standalone top-level selector (`^\s*\.name\s*[,{:]`),
 * which produced false "missing class" failures for the very common,
 * idiomatic pattern of a boolean/state modifier written as a compound
 * selector -- e.g. `.toggle.checked { ... }` for a `checked` prop. This is
 * confirmed to have blocked real generations in production: Toggle
 * (checked/unchecked/size16/24/32), Checkbox (size16/24/multi/b2b),
 * InputText (10+ state modifiers: filled/blur/error/focus/readOnly/
 * disabled/etc.), Accordion (opened/themeLight/themeDark), AvatarGroup
 * (themeLight/themeDark), BadgeCount (square) -- every one of these is a
 * modifier class the model correctly defined as a compound selector, which
 * the old anchored regex simply never looked past the first class of.
 *
 * This scans only the selector portion of each rule (text between the
 * previous `}`/start and the next `{`), so declaration values are never
 * mistaken for classes -- and couldn't be even without that: a class match
 * requires a letter/underscore/hyphen immediately after the dot, which
 * already excludes decimals like the `.5` in `scale(1.5)` or `48.5em`.
